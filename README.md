# CT-Scans-Structure-Segmentation

![Output example](/docs/segmentation_demo.png)<br>

## Overview

Segmentation, is an essential task in medical image processing. In this project, I explored medical CT scans and
software environments for CT scans. I experimented with thresholding for segmentation of the skeleton and the
aorta.

I developed the project during the
course [Medical Image Processing - 67705](https://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il/nu22/course/view.php?id=67705), taught at the
Hebrew University by Prof. Leo Joskowicz during spring semester of 2022/23.
This code was my submission for [MIP-2022-homework](docs/MIP-2022-homework.pdf).
